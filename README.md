 1. Data_preprocessing.pdf contains steps for hard-filtering, pre-processing of GATK outputs.
 2. [./Phasing_Haplotype/](Phasing_Haplotype) folder contains R scripts used in phasing haplotype and generating FastA files.
 3. [./Scripts/](Scripts) folder contrains miscellaneous scripts used in cleaning FastA files
 4. [./Raw_FASTA/](Raw_FASTA) folder contrains sequences used in the manuscripts
 5. [./common_haplotype/](common_haplotype) folder contains fasta sequences of the first 10 most common haplotypes for each antigen with H1 being the most common and H10 being the 10th most common haplotype - complementary to table S2.


Acknowledgment: We would like to thank Stuart Lee (Bahlo Lab) for the help and guidance for hard-filtering, pre-processing of GATK outputs.
